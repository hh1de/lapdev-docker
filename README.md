# Lapdev, but even easier

Lapdev (github.com/lapce/lapdev) is a .devcontaineir compatible selfhosted solution for pre-configured Dev environments and serves as a good alternative to GitHub Codespaces etc...

The problem with it is, that there's no official Docker  version, which is why i decided to go ahead and make Docker images based on Lapdev (github.com/lapce/lapdev)


# How to run it

The images will be built with docker-compose as main way to run it in mind.
